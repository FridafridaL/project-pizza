# Project Name

Making popupwindows for an order with alertmessage.
Due to the lecture with Diego were he was making popups about festivals I interpreted that we could do this project about what we wanted so I did it about Arts and craft.
I hope that was okey.

## The problem

I followed the instructions and looked att the teachingmaterial in notion. I have used google and stack overflow to find answers on problems.
I also tried chat gpt to help me discover errors that I couln't find. I wasn't familliar with Chat gpt but found it handy to detect why there was errors. Mostly it was errors like Declaration or Statement expected and I've put a semicolon were it shouldn't be.

If I had more time I whould have tried out other soulotions to have the same result. I feel like I just was trying to make this work and I think I've taken some detours in the code.
